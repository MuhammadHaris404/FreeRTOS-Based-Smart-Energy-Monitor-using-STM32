## Project Overview

This project implements a **real-time smart energy monitoring and billing system** using the **STM32F746 microcontroller** and **ESP32**. The system measures voltage and current, computes RMS values, calculates power and energy consumption, and uploads live data to the **Firebase cloud** using WiFi. The design follows a **FreeRTOS-based multi-task architecture**, ensuring deterministic operation and clean separation of responsibilities.

## Core Calculations

- **Current RMS**
\[
I_{rms} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum (i_n - \bar{i})^2}
\]

- **Power**
\[
P = V_{rms} \times I_{rms} \times PF
\]

- **Energy**
\[
Energy (kWh) = \frac{P \times t}{1000}
\]

- **Billing**
\[
Bill = Energy \times CostPerUnit
\]
